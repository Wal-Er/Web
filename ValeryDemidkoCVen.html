         <p>Summary:</p>

         <div>
            After 16+ years of successful experience in Oracle database administration (versions 8 to 19), I have decided to shift my career to pursue a long-held interest in programming. During my administrative work, I actively developed scripts, wrote SQL queries, and created PL/SQL procedures to automate processes, which provided me with a solid technical foundation. I am now eager to leverage my accumulated experience in a new role, enhance my development skills, and contribute to the creation of high-quality software. My goal is to start my career as a junior developer and grow professionally in this field.
